title: Callbacks
---

Vulcan uses a system of hooks and callbacks for many of its operations.

A **hook** is a specific point in the code where **callbacks** can be attached and executed. These callbacks are middleware-like functions that take in an argument, then pass it on to the next callback attached to the same hook. 

They are a handy way to inject your own code into other, pre-existing operations without having to modify the code of these operations directly. 

Callback functions can take more than one arguments, but the first argument is special in that - for sync callbacks â€“ it will be updated each time to reflect the return value of each successive function, letting you progressively iterate over a value or object. 

## Debugging

**If you've got the [debug package](/debug.html) enabled, a callback debugging UI is available at [http://0.0.0.0:3000/callbacks](http://0.0.0.0:3000/callbacks).**

## Adding Callback Functions

For example, here's how you would add a callback to `posts.edit.sync` to give posts an `editedAt` date every time they are modified:

```js
import { addCallback } from 'meteor/vulcan:core';

function setEditedAt (post, user) {
  post.editedAt = new Date();
  return post;
}
addCallback('posts.edit.sync', setEditedAt);
```

Vulcan's boilerplate mutations support three distinct types of callback functions, each with their own hook:

- `validate` callbacks are called to decide if an operation should run or not. 
- `sync` callbacks are called in a blocking manner before the database operation.
- `async` callbacks are called in a non-blocking manner, after the database operation. 

## Removing Callback Functions

If the callback function is named (i.e. declared using the `function foo () {}` syntax), you can also remove it from the callback using:

```js
import { removeCallback } from 'meteor/vulcan:core';

removeCallback('posts.edit.sync', "setEditedAt");
```

## Running Callback Hooks

Callbacks are run using the `Callbacks.runSync` and `Callbacks.runAsync` functions:

```js
modifier = Callbacks.run(`movies.edit.sync`, modifier, document, currentUser)
```

In each case, the **first** argument is the name of the callback hook, the **second** argument is the one iterated on by each callback function on the hook, while any remaining arguments are just passed along from one iteration to the next.

Note that for *sync* callbacks, each callback function should return the main argument to pass it on to the next function, while *async* callbacks don't need to return anything.

## Registering Callbacks

While you don't need to register new callback hooks to use them (as long as you do run them), registering a callback makes it easier to document and use it:

```js

import { registerCallback } from 'meteor/vulcan:lib';

registerCallback({
  name: `posts.new.validate`, 
  description: `Validate a document before insertion (can be skipped when inserting directly on server).`,  
  arguments: [{document: 'The document being inserted'}, {currentUser: 'The current user'}, {validationErrors: 'An object that can be used to accumulate validation errors'}], 
  runs: 'sync', 
  returns: 'document',
});
```

It takes the following arguments: 

- `name`: the name of the callback.
- `description`: a description of what the callback does. 
- `arguments`: an array of `{name: description}` objects describing the callback functions' arguments. 
- `runs`: whether the callback runs in a `sync` or `async` manner. 
- `returns`: what the callback is expected to return (for `sync` callbacks).

## Error Handling

Pass `break` on your `Error` object to cause the chain of callbacks to stop when using a *sync* callback.

```
function mySyncCallback() {
  try {
    const value = Posts.callingAFunctionThatDoesNotExistThisThrowsAnError();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    // Cause Vulcan to halt execution of resolver and throw the error to Apollo
    error.break = true;
    throw error;
  }
}

addCallback('posts.new.sync', mySyncCallback);
```
