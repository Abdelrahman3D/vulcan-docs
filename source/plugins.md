VulcanJS is open-sourced and community-based, so it features some plugins developped by the community:

- [ErikDakoda/vulcan-material-ui](https://github.com/ErikDakoda/vulcan-material-ui) : Replacement for Vulcan components using Material-UI.
- [voodooattack/file-scalar](https://github.com/voodooattack/file-scalar) : A `File` scalar for Vulcan.js to facilitate file uploads with GraphQL.
- [VulcanJS/vulcan-places](https://github.com/VulcanJS/vulcan-places) : Google Maps Places integration for Vulcan.
- [Apollinaire/vulcan-crisp](https://github.com/Apollinaire/vulcan-crisp) : Crisp integration

If you have written a package and would like to see it registered here, you can [edit this page](https://github.com/VulcanJS/vulcan-docs/blob/master/source/plugins.md) and submit a PR to the docs.
