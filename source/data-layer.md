title: Data Layer
---

Nova uses the [Apollo](http://apollostack.com) data layer to manage its [GraphQL API](http://graphql.org/). 

## Data Flow

When you connect to a GraphQL-powered site, the client makes an API request to load the data it needs. 

Unlike traditional REST APIs, the client doesn't just hit an API endpoint but actually sends a list of *what data it needs* to the server. The specific document properties needed by the client are defined in a **fragment**. 

Upon receiving that query, the server validates the fragment against the main GraphQL **schema**.

If that validation passes, the server then looks for a **query resolver** that will specify how to actually retrieve the data (presumably through some kind of database `find()` operation).

Data mutations (inserting, editing, or removing a document) function in a similar way.

The client sends a query that includes the name of the mutation, the mutation arguments, as well as specifies what data the client expects back once the mutation is complete. 

The server then looks for a **mutation resolver** and executes it.

## Helper Functions

Nova features a number of helpers to make settings up that data layer fast, most of which are initialized through the `createCollection` function:

```js
const Movies = createCollection({

  collectionName: 'movies',

  typeName: 'Movie',

  schema,
  
  resolvers,

  mutations,

});
```

The function takes the following arguments:

- `collectionName`: the name of the collection in your MongoDB database.
- `typeName`: the name of the GraphQL type that will be generated for the collection.
- `schema`, `resolvers`, `mutations`: see below.

<h2 id="schema">Schema</h2>

The first piece of any GraphQL API is the **schema**, which defines what data is made available to the client. 

In Nova, this GraphQL schema can be generated automatically from your collection's JSON schema, so you don't have to type things twice. Just pass a [SimpleSchema](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-simple-schema)-compatible JSON schema as `createCollection`'s `schema` property.

You can learn more on defining your schema in the [Schema](schema.html) section.

### Custom Schemas

If you need to manually add a schema, you can also do so using the `GraphQLSchema.addSchema` function:

```js
const customSchema = `
  input Custom {
    _id: String
    userId: String
    title: String
  }
`;
GraphQLSchema.addSchema(customSchema);
```

<h2 id="resolvers">Resolvers</h2>

You can pass a `resolver` object to `createCollection`. It should include three `list`, `single`, and `total` resolvers.

Each resolver should have the following properties:

- `name`: the resolver's name.
- `resolver`: the resolver function.

### List Resolver

The `list` resolver is used to display lists of documents. It takes the following arguments:

- `terms`: a JSON object containing a list of terms used to filter and sort the list.
- `offset`: how many documents to offset the list by (used for paginating requests).
- `limit`: how many documents to return.

It should return an array of documents.

### Single Resolver

The `single` resolver takes a `documentId` argument, and should return a single document.

### List Total Resolver

The `total` resolver takes a `terms` argument and should return the total count of results matching these terms in the database. 

### Custom Resolvers

Just like for the schema, you can also define resolvers manually using `GraphQLSchema.addResolvers`:

```js
const movieResolver = {
  Movie: {
    user(movie, args, context) {
      return context.Users.findOne({ _id: movie.userId }, { fields: context.getViewableFields(context.currentUser, context.Users) });
    },
  },
};
GraphQLSchema.addResolvers(movieResolver);
```

Resolvers can be defined on any new or existing type (e.g. `Movie`).

<h2 id="mutations">Mutations</h2>

Finally, `createCollection` also accepts a `mutations` object. This object should include three mutations, `new`, `edit`, and `remove`, each of which has the following properties:

- `name`: the name of the mutation.
- `check`: a function that takes the current user and (optionally) the document being operated on, and return `true` or `false` based on whether the user can perform the operation.
- `mutation`: the mutation function.

### New Mutation

Takes a single `document` argument.

### Edit Mutation

Takes three arguments:

- `documentId`: the document to modify.
- `set`: the fields to modify (as a list of field name/value pairs, e.g.`{title: 'My New Title', body: 'My new body'}`).
- `unset`: the fields to remove (as a list of field names/booleans, e.g. `{title: true, body: true}`).

### Remove Mutation

Takes a single `documentId` argument.

### Custom Mutations

You can also add your own mutations using `GraphQLSchema.addMutation` and `GraphQLSchema.addResolvers`:

```js

GraphQLSchema.addMutation('postsVote(documentId: String, voteType: String) : Post');

const voteResolver = {
  Mutation: {
    postsVote(root, {documentId, voteType}, context) {
      // do mutation
    },
  },
};

GraphQLSchema.addResolvers(voteResolver);
```

### Boilerplate Operations

Note that even when using the `new`, `edit`, and `remove` mutations, defining the actual operation is up to you.

But if you want to save time, you can import Telescope's own boilerplate mutations from `nova:lib`:

```js
import { newMutation, editMutation, removeMutation } from 'meteor/nova:lib';
```

They take the following arguments:

- `collection`: the collection affected.
- `document` (new) or `documentId` (edit, remove): the document or document ID.
- `set`, `unset` (edit only): the `set` and `unset` objects. 
- `currentUser`: the user performing the operation.
- `validate`: whether to validate the operation based on the current user.
- `context`: the resolver context.

If `validate` is set to `true`, these boilerplate operations will: 

- Check that the current user has permission to insert/edit each field.
- Validate the document against collection schema.
- Add `userId` to document (insert only).
- Run any validation callbacks (e.g. `movies.new.validate`).

They will then run the mutation's document (or the `set` modifier) through the collection's sync callbacks (e.g. `movies.new.sync`), perform the operation, and finally run the async callbacks (e.g. `movies.new.async`).

Callback hooks run with the following arguments:

- `new`: `newDocument`, `currentUser`.
- `edit`: `modifier`, `oldDocument`, `currentUser`.
- `remove`: `document`, `currentUser`.

You can learn more about callbacks in the [Callbacks](callbacks.html) section. 

<h2 id="hocs">Higher-Order Components</h2>

To make working with Apollo easier, Nova provides you with a set of higher-order components (HoC). 

An HoC is simply a function you can call on a React component to give it additional props.

### withList

The `withList` HoC is used to display lists of documents. It takes the following options:

- `queryName`: an arbitrary name for the query.
- `collection`: the collection on which to look for the `list` resolver.
- `fragment` or `fragmentName`: the fragment to use. If you pass `fragmentName` instead of `fragment`, the name you passed will be used to look up a fragment registered with `registerFragment`. 

For example:

```js
const listOptions = {
  collection: Movies,
  queryName: 'moviesListQuery',
  fragment: MoviesItem.fragment,
};

export default withList(listOptions)(MoviesList);
```

The resulting wrapped component also takes in the following options:

- `terms`: an object containing a list of querying, sorting, and filtering terms.

Note that `terms` needs to be passed not as an option, but as a prop from the *parent* component.

The HoC then passes on the following props:

- `loading`: `true` while the data is loading.
- `results`: the loaded array of documents.
- `totalCount`: the total count of results.
- `count`: the number of current results (i.e. `results.length`).
- `refetch`: a function that can be called to trigger a query refetch.
- `loadMore`: a function that can be called to load more data. 

### withDocument

The `withDocument` HoC displays a single document. It takes the same options as `withList`, but takes a `documentId` **prop**. 

Like `terms` for `withList`, `documentId` needs to be passed not as an option, but as a prop from the *parent* component.

This HoC then passes on the following child prop:

- `loading`: `true` while the data is loading.
- `document`: the loaded document.

### withNew

This HoC takes the following two options:

- `collection`: the collection to operate on.
- `fragment`: specifies the data to ask for as a return value.

And passes on a `newMutation` function to the wrapped component, which takes a single `document` argument.

### withEdit

Same options as `withNew`. The returned `editMutation` mutation takes three arguments: `documentId`, `set`, and `unset`. 

### withRemove

A single `collection` option. The returned `removeMutation` mutation takes a single `documentId` argument. 

Note that when using the [Forms](forms.html) module, all three mutation HoCs are automatically added for you. 

## Fragments

A fragment is a piece of schema, usually used to define what data you want to query for. 

### Registering Fragments

You can register fragments by passing the fragment string to `registerFragment`:

```js
import { registerFragment } from 'meteor/nova:core';

registerFragment(`
  fragment PostsList on Post {
    _id
    title
    url
    slug
  }
`);
```

### Using Fragments

You can get a fragment with:

```js
import { getFragment } from 'meteor/nova:lib';

getFragment('PostsList');
```

### Sub-Fragments

When registering a fragment, you'll often want to use sub-fragments to avoid repeating frequently used properties. For example, the `PostsList` fragment uses the `UserMinimumInfo` fragment:

```js
registerFragment(`
  fragment PostsList on Post {
    # nova:posts
    _id
    title
    url
    slug
    user {
      ...UsersMinimumInfo
    }
  }
`);
```

Note that in “regular” Apollo code, you need to include any sub-fragment used by a fragment [as tagged template literal](http://dev.apollodata.com/react/fragments.html#reusing-fragments), but Nova takes care of this for you (provided you've previously registered any sub-fragment using `registerFragment`).

### Extending Fragments

You often need to add one or more properties to a fragment without modifying its existing properties. You can do this with `extendFragment`:

```js
import { extendFragment } from 'meteor/nova:lib';

extendFragment('PostsList', `
  color # new custom property!
`);
```

This is the same as registering the entire `PostsList` fragment with `color` tacked on at the end. 

### Replacing Fragments

To replace a fragment completely, you can just register it again under the same name. 

```js
import { registerFragment } from 'meteor/nova:lib';

registerFragment(`
  fragment UsersMinimumInfo on User {
    _id
    slug
    username
    # displayName # remove this
    # emailHash # and this
    mySuperCustomProperty # but add this
  }
`);
```

Note that you can replace both “regular” fragments and sub-fragments.
