Here's a [video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qibyA_ReqEQ) of [the code](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope/tree/master/packages/example-instagram) for the `example-instagram` package.

### Image Upload

This example uses [the `vulcan:forms-upload` package](forms-upload.html), which  uploads images to [Cloudinary](http://cloudinary.com).
